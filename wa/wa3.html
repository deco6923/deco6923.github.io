    <p>In high school, Musto was the singer of Florida-based rock band Polaroid. They released one album, Paint The Town; one EP, Inside And Out; and one demo, The Cure Demo and have been variously described as being a pop punk,[6] punk rock,[7] and garage band.[4] During Musto's freshman year of high school, the band signed to Leakmob Records.[6][8] Musto dropped out of school in the 10th grade to focus on music.[4] As Polaroid progressed, their music became increasingly influenced by emo. By 2008, Musto had also begun to write his own solo music.[6]</p>

    <p>After leaving Polaroid, Musto began a solo career when he moved to Atlanta to work with Ne-Yo.[9] He put out his first EP entitled Brightness in 2008, followed by Contrast in 2009, and Exposure in 2010. He put out the Christmas song "I Hate the Holidays" with Tyler Carter, then-member of the band Woe, Is Me in late-2010, shortly followed by a new single, "Douche Bag" in early-January 2011. In mid-2011, Musto released both the Gone for Good EP and the Year of the Blackbear EP. In fall 2011, Musto decided to use his nickname Blackbear as his pseudonym when making music. The first song to be released with the Blackbear moniker is Mike Posner's "Marauder Music" in November 2011.[10]</p>

    <p>Musto co-wrote Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend",[11] a number 2 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2012. Intent on pursuing a career as an R&B singer, Musto released his debut EP Foreplay on April 20, 2012, and his debut mixtape Sex on October 31, 2012. Both releases were under the name Blackbear, and Sex featured collaborations from fellow "Boyfriend" co-writer Mike Posner, along with producers, singers, and songwriters James Blake and Maejor Ali.[12] He also appeared on Machine Gun Kelly's "End of the Road" from the Lace Up album, released October 9, 2012. On April 20, 2014, Blackbear released The Afterglow EP,[13] which landed him number four on Billboard's Uncharted listing of releases from upcoming artists.[14]</p>

    <h3 id="2015">2015: Deadroses and Help</h3>

    Blackbear released his first full-length album, Deadroses, a self-released set of 10 tracks, on February 14, 2015.
