    <h1>Welcome to the Chaos!</h1>
    <p>
        Hello everybody! My name is Destiny Cool. Before we get too far, 
        I would like to point out that <strong>yes</strong> my last name is actually <em>cool</em>. 
    </p>
    <h2><em>A Little About Me</em></h2>
    <p>
        <u>Here are a few things about me.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        I go by she/her/hers pronouns. I am currently a junior here at CU-Boulder and 
        I am majoring in CTD now. I used to be a Biochemical Engineering major and quickly 
        found out that organic chemistry and differential equations are the banes of my existence. 
        Too many tears have been shed.
    <p>
        My dream is to work in the medical device industry after graduating. I want to design and create prosthetics 
        for military veterans.

        I am excited to learn more about how to manipulate websites
        to make them more efficient and more appealing. I currently work as a social media manager 
        for a Swiss woman that has a business and sports podcast. I am redesigning her website and 
        know that I need to learn HTML to accomplish the things that I want to make her website better.
