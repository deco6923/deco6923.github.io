    <h3><u>Errors Found</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Error 1: At the top of the page, you need to declare the doctype. Therefore, I added doctype html so the page was read in html by the browser. 
        </li>
        <li>Error 2: The next error was with establishing the language of the page using html language. To fix this error, I placed the html tag outside of the head element and used html lang = 'en'. </li>
        <li>Error 3: The next error was not adding the metadata needed for the page in the head element. Therefore, I added the charset as UTF-8 and included the name and content with another meta tag.</li>
        <li>Error 4: The next error was not closing the head element. Therefore, I closed the head element with /head.</li>
        <li>Error 5: The next error was not closing the h1 element properly. Therefore, I closed the h1 element with /h1. </li>
        <li>Error 6: The next error was not opening the p element properly. Therefore, I opened the p element with p.</li>
        <li>Error 7: The next error was the mismatch ol and ul tags for the list. Therefore, I closed the ordered list with /ol.</li>
        <li>Error 8: The next error was not closing the p element properly. Therefore, I closed the p element with /p.</li>
        <li>Error 9: The next error was with the img element. The img element needs two attributes: scr and alt to be fully functional. Therefore, I added and defined the alt attribute.</li>
        <li>Error 10: The next error was with the anchor tag and closing the img element. Since the img element is a null element, you do not need to close the img element with /img. Instead, I deleted the /img closing tag and added /a to close the anchor tag properly.</li>
        <li>Error 11: The next error was not closing the table element properly. Therefore, I closed the table element with /table at the end of the table.</li>
        <li>Error 12: The next error was not closing the title description element properly with the '25' text. Therefore, I closed the td element with /td.</li>
        <li>Error 13: The next error was using the word 'source' instead of 'src' to link the image properly. Therefore, I replaced 'source' with src.</li>
        <li>Error 14: The next error was using the tag 'center' to center the text. The 'center' tag is not supported in HTML5. Therefore, I used the style attribute to center the text instead by writing style="text-align:center" with the use of the paragraph element.</li>
        <li>Error 15: The next error was using bgcolor to change the background color of the text. Therefore, I used style="background-color:lightgray;" to change the background color for the text.</li>
        <li>Error 16: The next error was not closing a comment properly. Therefore, I closed the comment by using '- - >'.</li>
        <li>Error 17: The next error was not closing the p and em tags in the correct order. Therefore, I closed the em tag with /em right after the text and closed the entire text with /p after the /em tag.</li>
        <li>Error 18: The next error was not using the right element to underline the text. Em is used to italicize the text. Therefore, I changed the em tags with u which underlines the text.</li>
        <li>Error 19: The next error was using the wrong tags for the descriptive list. Li tags are only used for ordered, unordered, and menu lists. Therefore, I changed the li tags for the descriptive item title with dt and /dt.</li>
        <li>Error 20: The last error is at the bottom of the page. Li tags cannot be used for a descriptive list. Therefore, I changed the li tags to dd and /dd for the descriptive item text.</li>
